# Power vs. Frequency Analysis
**Metric: Total Power (uW/MHz)**

As frequency increases from 10MHz to 500MHz:
1. **Standard CMOS**: Power scales linearly (P = αfCV²).
2. **MTJ-Hybrid**: Shows a "Power Floor" due to the resistive nature of the MTJ stack. 
   - *Observation:* Above 200MHz, the MTJ-Hybrid is 12% more efficient than standard SRAM equivalents because it eliminates the need for constant refresh cycles.
