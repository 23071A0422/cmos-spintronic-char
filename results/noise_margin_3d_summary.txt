3D PLOT DATA SUMMARY: NOISE MARGIN
----------------------------------
X-Axis: Supply Voltage (1.6V to 2.0V)
Y-Axis: Temperature (-40C to 125C)
Z-Axis: Static Noise Margin (SNM) in mV

Key Observation: At 125C and 1.6V (CERN Worst Case), 
the SNM drops to 320mV. This represents a 45% reduction 
from nominal conditions, requiring a Schmitt-Trigger 
input buffer for radiation-hardened DAQ sensors.
