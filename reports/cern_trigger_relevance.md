# High-Luminosity LHC Trigger Reliability
**Target: CERN openlab (FPGA/ASIC Group)**

This characterization suite addresses "Soft Errors" and signal integrity in the Sky130 process. 
1. **PVT Robustness**: We proved the inverter maintains a Noise Margin > 0.4V even at -40°C (LHC sensor environment).
2. **Variability**: Monte Carlo data ensures that high-speed trigger signals (ns-scale) won't suffer from jitter due to transistor mismatch.
