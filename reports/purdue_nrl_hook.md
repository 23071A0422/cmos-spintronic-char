# Research Proposal: Spintronic Hybrid CMOS Characterization
**Candidate: Gadipalli Varun Sai Kumar**

This suite proves readiness for **NRL Research** by:
1.  **Macro-modeling**: Integrating Physics-based MTJ models into industry-standard PDK flows.
2.  **Drive Strength Optimization**: Determining the exact W/L ratio required to flip magnetic states while maintaining thermal stability.
3.  **Low-Power Innovation**: Demonstrating how MTJ non-volatility can reduce leakage power in Sky130 edge-computing nodes.
