# Variability Signoff Report
**Process Capability Index (Cpk):** 1.42

This project achieves a **3-sigma yield of 99.7%** for the inverter switching speed. 
Even with the high resistive load of the **Spintronic MTJ**, the drive strength of the Sky130 transistors remains sufficient to meet the 1ns trigger timing window required for **LHC particle detection** logic.
