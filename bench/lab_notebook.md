# Lab Measurement Log: Sky130 Characterization
**Date: 2026-01-03**
**Equipment:** Tektronix MSO58, 1GHz Probes.

## Experiment 1: Inverter Rise/Fall Times
- VDD = 1.8V (Measured 1.792V at chip pin).
- Room Temp: 25.4°C.
- Measured Rise Time (Tr): 1.15ns.
- Measured Fall Time (Tf): 0.92ns.
- Note: 5% overshoot observed due to board parasitic capacitance (~2pF).
